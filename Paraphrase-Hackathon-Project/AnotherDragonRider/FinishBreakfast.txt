You finish your breakfast and stash your tray with the dishwashers.
On your way back to your table you hear Fabius approaching as his signature leather boots
clack against the wooden slats of the deck.
"All cadets, rise," you hear him command from out on the deck.
Trays clatter and benches scrape as the whole deck stands up, soon followed by those in the hall.
"I'll be taking pine class, the rest of you can return to your meal," Fabius declared, and most of the cadets sat back down.
Pine class, that means you!
You eagerly join the group that's quickly forming behind Fabius.
