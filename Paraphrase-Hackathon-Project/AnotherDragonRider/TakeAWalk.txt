The air smells young.
The sun is bright, but everything is still cool.
The pine trees that grow sporatically among the dusty red rocks sway in the breeze.
It's going to be a windy day, which is worrying, but nothing you can't handle.
You've been training for this, it's been months now, maybe years, you weren't counting.
Really the training started when you saw those photographs of your grandfather.
If you had rider blood then you could be a rider, regardless of what your parents said.
They could only stop you from going to the academy for so long. Once the recruiters knew you 
were the grandson of [LastName] the great they took you with open arms.
He was such a great man, they didn't even bother to know his first name.

You stroll down from the boy's cabbins down towards the bench by the lamp post.
You can see the edge of the canyon from here, and beyond. Far off in the distance is their nest.
It almost looks like a castle from here, but human hands did not carve those walls.
People shuffle around and between the paths and buildings below you, some on the very canyon's edge.
They are riders, you can just tell by the way they moved. Walking with such ease mere feet, maybe inches
from that perelous plumet. Yes they were human, but they didn't move like it. They were something
else, something above human. You would be too, soon at least. You had a cadet's uniform for now, 
and there was no shame in that. You were walking the path, and you'd get there eventually.

You heard footsteps scrape against the sand behind you. Turning around you can see a small group of
cadets heading to the mess hall. You recognize Tanis and some of her bunk mates. It's probably too late
to approach them, but you can probably catch up with them at the mess hall.
