You dream of flight.
It feels so real. #DidDream=1#
The air rushes through your hair, blasts your face but you see clearly through your goggles.
Your dragon swoops down low over the sun drenched canyon below.
Deep down you know, this isn't real, not yet.
You feel hands around your waste, a head on your shoulder.
Tanis is riding behind you, holding on to you gently as your Dragon banks and turns to face the sun.
It doesn't make sense why she's riding with you, she has her own dragon.
Or at least she will, you both will, after you wake up.
This is only a dream after all.
The sun shines bright in your face, you see a man on the edge of the canyon.
You recognise him instantly but don't question why he's alive.
Your grandfather, you never met him. Only knew him from old photographs hidden away in a dusty book in the attic.
Photographs almost as old as the camera its self.
He was a dragon rider, something your parents had hidden from you until they caught you looking at the book, as if they were ashamed of it.
But there was nothing to be ashamed of, he was a great man, and you can tell he is proud of you.
You were following in his footsteps. {nameNumber=3 whith a name like "Ryder" what choice did you have in the matter?} 
You open your mouth to say something to him, to shout above the rushing air.
But instead you open your real mouth, you shattered the dream.
Even though your eyes are closed, you can't deny the fact that you are awake.
