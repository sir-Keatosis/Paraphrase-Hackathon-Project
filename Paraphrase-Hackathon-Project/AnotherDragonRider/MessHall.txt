You hear the morning bugel start just as you head in to the doors to the mess hall.
It's already up and bustling. The tables on the inside are filling up quickly,
but there is still some space on deck. You get in line and load up your tray.
Bacon, eggs, and beans on toast. Beans are pretty much a constant here, served with every meal.
Mainly because they're light and easy to trasport this far into the mountains, and allegedly
they stay down pretty well. If the riders liked them that was enough for you to like them too.
...
Even if the cooks do make them kind of bland.

The mess hall is devided down the middle, boys on the left, girls on the right. Sort of an old
tradition that was falling out of favor with the newer cadets and staff. Most of the people who
still followed the rule did it out of respect for tradition, rather than any personal belife in
the practice. There are a few covetted seats that fill up quickly, the ones that run down the middle.
A spot where the boys can eat with the girls without breaking tradition. The seats are covetted,
but of course they also come with a connotation.
Out the window you can see Tanis and her group of friends sitting out on the deck, right on the threshold
between the two sides.
