"Wow, you must be really passionate about dragons," Kyle replies.
"More than you know," you sigh, "I just see them and I just feel... feel like... belonging you know? I belong in the sky"
"That's a good way to put it," he says, nodding, "But you look like... I dunno... hungry for 'em or something. Maybe hungry's not the right word"
"And you're not?" You say back, somewhat insulted.
"Hey, I don't need to long for what I already have," Kyle laughs, pointing at his chest for added affect.
"Wait... you're already-" you stammer.
"A rider, yeah, I'm wearing my Cadet stripes because you know, it's a thursday, but-" Kyle explains.
"Wow, I didn't know, I'm sorry," You reply shaking your head in embarassment.
"What are you apologizing for man? You've done nothing wrong, you haven't 'dissrespected' me or anything," Kyle laughs.
You open your mouth to say something but can't find the words.
"Yeah I get it, we can be a little intimidating some times, I know, but we're just people," Kyle says.
"It can be hard to believe that sometimes," you reply.
"Hey, the only difference between a Cadet and a Rider is time," he says looking at the emblem on your shoulder.
"And from the looks of it," he continues, "Yeah, Pine Class? You should be up in the air pretty soon anyways."
Your heart leaps.
"You didn't hear it from me you understand," he jokes, nudging you in the ribs, "Supposed to keep that stuff secret." #Doom+1#
"Why?" you ask, "Why keep it a secret."
"You just... you gotta stay humble, you can't let it go to your head. I dunno Fabius explains it better than I ever could." Kyle mumbles.
You look at the clock on the wall, Fabius will be here soon to start the day's instruction.
