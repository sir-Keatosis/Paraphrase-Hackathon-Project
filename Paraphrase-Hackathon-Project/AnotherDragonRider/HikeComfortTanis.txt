"Pick up the pace," Fabius commands, "As I always remind you, your physical fitness is as important to being a rider
as any lesson I can teach you."
You want to stay at the front and maintain your place, prove that you can keep pace with him, but you know what you have to do.
You slow down until you're on pace with Tanis, her eyes are glued to the ground as she strolls at the bare minimum speed to keep pace.
"Are you alright?" you ask.
"I'll graduate late if I fall and break a bone," Tanis laments.
"You won't graduate at all if you can't pass the simulator," you reply.
"Great, thanks, that makes me feel soooo much better," Tanis says sarcastically.
You sigh with frustration, admittedly that wasn't the best thing to say to her.
"Tanis, even if you don't believe in yourself... I do. I believe in you, I know you can do this," you say.
"You should worry about yourself," Tanis replies.
"Here, I'll cut you a deal," you offer, "You can worry about me, and I'll worry about you, but don't waste time worrying about yourself."
"You have no idea how stupid that sounds," Tanis laughs, "But sure why not?"
"Pick up the pace!" Fabius calls again. #TanisAffection+1#
You don't have enough breath to keep the conversation going, but you keep your pace with her regardless.
You begin to slow down as the trail starts to snake closer to the edge of th canyon, the rocks are loose and the path is narrow.
You're about half way to the simulator.
