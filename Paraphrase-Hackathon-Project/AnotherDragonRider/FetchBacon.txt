"Here, I'll go get you some more bacon," You offer.
"No, [FirstName] you don't have to," she replies, blushing.
You stand up anyways. #TanisAffection+1# #Connotation+1#
"You complained, so I'm gonna get it for you, riders need a full breakfast," You laugh.
Just as you get back in line for more food you hear the booming voice of the trainer Fabius.
"All cadets, rise," you hear him command from out on the deck.
Trays clatter and benches scrape as the whole deck stands up, soon followed by those in the hall.
"I'll be taking pine class, the rest of you can return to your meal," Fabius declared, and most of the cadets sat back down.
Pine class, that means you! Quickly you deposit Tanis' tray on the first open surface you can find and go to join the rest
of Pine class that's gathering on the deck.
