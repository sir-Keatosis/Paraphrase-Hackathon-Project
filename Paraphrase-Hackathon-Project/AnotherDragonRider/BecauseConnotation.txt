Kyle laughs, "Oh man, I remember being worried about the 'Connotation' like that. Yeah some people care but, it's
really not a big deal. I mean, you know what they say, 'Brids don't get Birds', [FirstName] so live life while you can."
"I have never heard that phrase," you laugh uncomfortably, "What's it supposed to mean?"
"Birds, it's what some people call dragon riders," Kyle explains, "I mean once you're in that life you're IN IT, long haul.
You can't have a family AND a dragon, they make you pick. If you've got the feelies for a girl then go for it. You're not 
gonna have the chance after you get your wings so why not?"
