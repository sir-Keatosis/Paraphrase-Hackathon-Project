A group of about 24 cadets forms around Fabius. What remains of Pine Class.
The last run on the simulator had put the other half of Pine Class in the hospital and made
Fabius reconsider his "No straps" policy. You didn't even get to try the simulator that time...
"We have a long hike ahead of us," Fabius declares, his stoic athority cutting through the palpable 
stress of the cadets that follow him. You push to be in the front of the pack, you want to be first in line.
Riders aren't afraid, Riders face challenges head on, and a surprisingly small number of riders die from falling
off their dragons so you should be fine!
Tanis lingers near the tail of the pack as the group makes their way out from the shade of the camp and across the 
arid terrain along the canyon. You can tell the simulator has been stressing her out, she stares straight ahead.
