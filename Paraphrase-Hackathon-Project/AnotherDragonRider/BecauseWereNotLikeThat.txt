Kyle lets out an amused chuckle {DidDream 
 "Kinda wish my freinds looked at me the way you do at her, but whatever"}
You can't help but roll your eyes.
{DidDream<1 "Honestly," you say, "We're just friends. I haven't felt 'that way' about anyone since I was in school" #KyleAffection+1# } {DidDream=1 "I get it," Kyle says, "Not everyone's got that kinda confidence. I'll drop it for now if you want" }
Kyle crunches loudly on his bean tost before speaking up once more.
"Now correct me if I'm wrong, but did you say your last name was [LastName] ?" Kyle asks.
You nod your head.
"Incredible," Kyle remarks, "You know, I think I speak for everyone here when I say we're so glad to have another [LastName] with us.
I mean, I've only heard stories, but if any of them are true you're destined for greatness my man."
"I've never heard those stories," You admit.
"Ah, yeah, makes sense, yeah... well they're good stories so maybe I'll catch you up some time," he offeres.
You feel slightly uncomfortable that he knows more about your grandfather than you do, but you take him up on his offer.
"I'll see you around, [FirstName] " he says, finishing his meal and getting up from his seat.
