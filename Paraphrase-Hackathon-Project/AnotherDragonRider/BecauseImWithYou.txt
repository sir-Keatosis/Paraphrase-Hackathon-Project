"Aww, man, you're too kind" he says, with a dismissive hand gesture, "Careful, keep talking like that and it might go to my head."
He has long hair so blond it almost looks white with the beginnings of stubble growing up and down his strong jawline.
His peircing green eyes match the green Pine Class emblem on his chest. #KyleAffection+3# 
"Hey, you're also in Pine Class," you remark.
"No, I got my wings man, I just keep it on for sentimental purposes," he replies.
"You're a Rider?" you ask as your jaw hangs open slightly, you've probably never been this close to one before.
"Wow, yeah I'm only a Cadet," You remark, shaking your head.
"Not for long, my man, I hear Fabius saying Pine class is making record time, could have their wings in a week," Kyle says.
Your heart leaps.
"Maybe once you get your wings we could fly together some time," he says.
"I oh would... that would... yeah my god that would be amazing," you stammer.
"Hey hey hey, [FirstName] my guy, calm down," he laughs, "Birds are people too."
You look at him, somewhat confused.
"Riders, some people call them birds. We're just people!" he gestures first to himself and then to you for emphasis.
"It can be hard to forget sometimes," you admit.
Kyle laughs.
You decide to eat some of your food to stop yourself from fanboying any harder.
"Hey, I gotta be in the air in a few minutes," Kyle declares, standing up, "so help yourself to the rest of my Bacon. I'll see you soon, alright [FirstName] ?"
