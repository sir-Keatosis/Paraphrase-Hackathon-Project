"I had a pretty cool dream last night as well," you say. #TanisAffection-1#
"Oh really?" Tanis says, sounding only slightly interested. #Doom+1#
"Yeah you were there," you say, "We were riding a Dragon together, and I saw my grandfather-"
"You're not supposed to do that, you know, ride with anyone else unless it's an emergency," Trish pipes up.
"Well, okay you can't get me for breaking the rules in a dream, come on" you protest.
Tanis finds that funny and lets out a small chuckle.
"Anyways my grandfather was-" you try to start but you get cut off again.
"Okay, 'Chosen One' whatever you say," Trish replies sarcastically.
"Seriously why are you heckling me like this, also why 'Chosen One'?" you snap, "Can you at least let me finish?"
"Because you never shut up about how the great [LastName] was your grandfather. Like, okay, we get it," Trish snaps back.
"Okay, wow, you two," Tanis said, frustratedly standing up, "I guess I'll go sit somewhere else."
Both you and Trish exchange nasty looks.
You feel like an asshole just sitting there in the middle seat with nothing to show for it.
