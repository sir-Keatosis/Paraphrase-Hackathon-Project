"What was your dream about?" you ask.
"Okay so it was another one of those stress dreams..." Tanis begins, slapping the table
and turning to face you for added emphasis.
"I was on the mechanical simulator, right, probably because we're going back there again today
and I got up on it, and it started lifting into the air and it just got higher and higher and higer
and then it was just falling into the canyon..."
"Oh my god, that sounds awful," You comment.
"No it get's better I promise," Tanis continued, "Because the thing hit the bottom of the canyon and
bounced back up, and then it fell back down and bounced back up, but the seccond time I let go and I was
just floating up in the sky. And I could just fly wherever I wanted to. I sorta figured out it was a 
dream by then, so I just went around to show everyone, and everyone thought it was super amazing, even Fabius."
"Wow" you remark.
"Yeah and then somebody had to wake me up," Tanis snarks, looking back at her friends.
The group laughs, and you laugh along with them. {DidDream 
"I dream about flying all the time, but never like that, always with my dragon... with a dragon at least," you add
"I can't imagine what my dragon will be like," Tanis replies, "Sometimes I worry... that... I don't know."
"Tanis, you're an amazing cadet, if Fabius had any doubt in you, in any of us, he would have said something by now." #TannisAffection+1# }
